# Welcome to my 👩🏾‍💻100 days of code👩🏾‍💻 repository!!

I will be starting the 100 days of code challenge with Python. Updates will be placed here ~~daily from 1st December.~~ on a regular basis (I resumed the 100 days of code again on 1st December 2021, what a surprise!).

I am using the udemy course by Angela Yu for the challenge and I will try my best to do it daily.

Start date: 1st December 2020
Proposed finish date: ~~11th March 2021~~ ~~some point before September 2021 hopefully🙏🏿~~ SOME POINT IN 2022 I PROMISE!!

The repository is organised as followed:

- Code from each day will be in their own folder, within the overall python difficulty 
- I have notes from each day as well which will be collated into each difficulty i.e. one md file for beginner python notes

UPDATE (01/12/2021): Currently on Day 31 - Sending emails using SMTP (Starting Intermediate+ Python Projects)

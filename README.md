# Welcome to my 👩🏾‍💻100 days of code👩🏾‍💻 repository!!

I will be starting the 100 days of code challenge with Python. Updates will be placed here ~~daily from 1st December.~~ on a regular basis. Typically the challenge is done everyday, but I will be completing this challenge in my own time. I aim to complete this challenge though. I am using the udemy course by Angela Yu for the challenge.

Proposed finish date: ~~11th March 2021~~ some point before September 2021 hopefully🙏🏿

The repository is organised as followed:

- Code from each day will be in their own folder, within the overall python difficulty 
- I have notes from each day as well which will be collated into each difficulty i.e. one md file for beginner python notes

About 95% of the code written in the respository is my own. While I used the udemy course to get each daily challenge, I understand the importance of coding solutions to problems by myself.

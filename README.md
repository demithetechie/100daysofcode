# 100daysofcode

I will be starting the 100 days of code challenge with Python. Updates will be placed here daily from 1st December.

# Day 1 - Printing, Variables, Strings

Challenge: Band Name Generator

Important notes: Use \n for a newline.

# Day 2 - Data Types (Strings, Integers, Floats and Booleans), Mathematical Operations, String and Number Manipulation, F strings

Challenge: Tip Calculator

Important notes: Using indexes on strings to reference a character of a string. Strings can be added together to form longer strings.

```python
print("Hello"[0])
print("Hello"[4])
print("Hello"[-1])
```
The first print will return "H", the second will return "o" and the third will also return "o". An index of -1 always returns the last index of a string. This is very useful where you do not know the length of the string. An index of 0 always returns the first index of a string.

You can use _ in place of , when writing large numbers. Both numbers below are read the same way in Python.

```python
123456789
123_456_789 
```
Use `type()` function to return the data type of a variable. Exponents in Python are accomplished using the ** operator. The function `round()` rounds a float to the nearest whole number. It can take an additional parameter of how many decimal points the float should be rounded to. Floor division (division without the remainder) can be accomplished with the // operator. Modulus (the remainder of a division) can be accomplished with the % operator. `+=, -=, /= and *=` manipulate integer/float values by its previous value. 

F strings (formatted strings) are ways to embed expressions into a string using minimal syntax:

```python
score = 0
print(f"Your score is {score}")
```
Curly brackets are used to refer to a variable. The f must be writted before the string, to indicate to python that this is a f string.

# Day 3 - Conditional Statements, Logical Operators, Code Blocks and Scope
